<h1>first journal entry</h1>
<p>this is my first journal entry</p>
<p>i love julian</p>
<p> 9/21 This is my first journal entry I learned how to put this code on a website and I am having a good time. I like to code and coding is the best in the world. Julian gets on my nerves alot. Luke is pretty goofy as well. I like to use github. You have to write cd./desktop/_.github.io. Then git add . today all we did was work on how to start writing your journal on the website</p>
<p> 10/31. I made my own halloween project when a guy is walking down a road. During this walk if u click the mouse then an evil laugh sound comes on which implies someone is stalking them and and is going to do something evil to them</p>
<p>11/16. I made a gratitude project for my mom. I copied my old animation code and used it to make the basketball div move into and down into the hoop. I have 2 divs which are the hoop and the ball. Once I make a function that allows the click to move the ball, once the ball gets into the hoop I will have pictures of me and my mom come up on the screen. it will say happy thanksgiving and she will be very happy.</p>
<p> 1/9. I made a list of goals I have for 2024. There are a list of different things that decide what my main goals will be.</p>
<p>1/16. I started making my array and added a bunch of different pictures of this guy named kumalala. </p>
